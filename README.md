# portfolio

Hi! My name is Clara Wong and I am an electrical and biomedical engineering student at McMaster University. I am an enthusiastic student who is looking to gain more experience as a web developer, front-end developer, and back-end developer.

Here, I have included the work I've done for my personal portfolio. I hope you have as much fun interacting with it as much as I had making it! 

Feel free to reach to me at clarawong20@gmail.com or call/text me at (905) 226-9930. Thank you for checking my portfolio out!
